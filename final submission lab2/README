## Description

- **Task 1: Webserver**
  - Responsible for running a webserver that handles GET and HEAD requests from a web browser or Postman.

- **Task 2: DNS Server**
  - Responsible for running a server and a client server that handles DNS questions and answers about a specific domain.

## How to Run the Code

   ### Task 1: Webserver

      1. Navigate on the terminal until you reach the folder where `webserver.py`.

      2. Run the Python file `webserver.py`:
         - Using Python 3: `python3 webserver.py` or `py webserver.py`.
         - Make sure that `HelloWorld.html` and `404_not_found.html` are under the same folder as `webserver.py`.

      3. Open your web browser or Postman and enter the URL:
         - URL without a folder, getting the correct HTML object: [http://127.0.0.1:11000/HelloWorld.html]
         - URL without a folder, resulting in a 404 error: [http://127.0.0.1:11000/HelloWorlds.html]

      4. To close the webserver, simply terminate the terminal.

   ### Task 2: DNS Server

      1. Navigate on the terminal until you reach the folder where `server.py` and `client.py` are located.

      2. Run the server Python file `server.py`:
         - Using Python 3: `python3 server.py` or `py server.py`.

      3. Run the client Python file `client.py` on a different terminal:
         - Using Python 3: `python3 client.py` or `py client.py`.

      4. In the client terminal, you will be asked to enter a domain:
         - Domains found on the server are : "google.com," "youtube.com," "uwaterloo.ca," "wikipedia.org," and "amazon.ca."
         - If other domains are entered, the client will not receive any answer and will get the RCODE "0011."

      5. The client terminal will print the related IPv4 to your domain; if not found, it will print an error message saying it didn't find the related IPv4.

      6. In the `client.py`, it will print in hexadecimals the query from the client and the response that it sends.

      7. To close the client, type the domain "end."

      8. To close the server, terminate the terminal.

## Notes

- Ensure Python 3 is installed on your system.
- Ensure that the libraries `socket`, `random`, and `os` are installed on the device.
- Make sure that `HelloWorld.html` and `404_not_found.html` are under the same folder as `webserver.py`.
- The webserver runs on [http://127.0.0.1:11000/].
